# Supplementary Materials for Visualizing Tests for Equality of Covariance Matrices

This project pertains to the supplementary materials for Friendly & Sigal's paper for visualizaing tests of equality for covariance matrices. The main page is located at: [https://mattsigal.github.io/eqcov_supp/](https://mattsigal.github.io/eqcov_supp/) and provides links for downloading the raw R scripts, previewing the rendered output, as well as a link to download the complete R script bundle as an archive.  

Questions and commentary can be directed to either @friendly or @mattsigal.

The article pertains to the testing for equality of and visualization of covariance matrices in multivariate designs.   \r\n\r\n`R` code is provided throughout the article with commentary, and is provided here in fully reproducible form. The code is divided into 4 files: one for each primary example, and one for the work with `betadisper()`.   \r\n\r\n| Dataset/Topic | R Script | Rendered HTML |\r\n|:-------------:|:--------:|:-------------:|\r\n|      Iris     |   [Link](https://github.com/mattsigal/eqcov_supp/blob/master/iris-ex.R)   |      [Link](https://github.com/mattsigal/eqcov_supp/blob/master/iris-ex.html)     |\r\n|      Wine     |   Link   |      Link     |\r\n|     Skulls    |   Link   |      Link     |\r\n|   betadisper  |   Link   |      Link     |\r\n\r\n",
